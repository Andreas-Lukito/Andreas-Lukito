# üí´ About Me:
I am a Data Science student passionate about exploring the intersections of machine learning, data science, and a bit of entrepreneurship. Most of my projects revolve around applying Python to real-world problems, ranging from time-series forecasting and image recognition models to developing web applications that make daily life easier. Currently, I am also working on research projects in deep learning and classification, where I enjoy experimenting with models and understanding how they can be optimized for real applications.<br><br>I see myself as someone who is curious, adaptable, and always eager to learn. Whether it‚Äôs improving my technical skills, building new projects, or simply making a good cup of coffee, I approach challenges with resilience and creativity. My long-term goal is to grow both as a developer, combining technology and human-centered design to create solutions that make a positive impact.
